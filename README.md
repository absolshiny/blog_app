# First Blogg
## Description
This is a simple blogg page, it includes the backend(express js), frontend (react) and a db (postgres)
I used docker containers to build the whole applications because I wanted to be able to make sure that it will run anyware.
The docker containers was a challenge (as most of this app honestly) but in the end it helps me to keep evrythin on one enviroment.
